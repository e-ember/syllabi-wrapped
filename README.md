#Syllabi Wrapped

We’re targeting the biggest common problem all college students have during Week 0: reading over the syllabus.

Diving into Canvas for the syllabus for each course throughout the year is annoying, which is why we’re building a platform that puts all important class info like grade weightage and test dates in one place… with a twist!

In a Spotify Wrapped-inspired theme, we display each course's important syllabus information in an engaging, interactive, and colorful story format! Easy to navigate through, Syllabi Wrapped is a great tool for all college students managing their courses.
